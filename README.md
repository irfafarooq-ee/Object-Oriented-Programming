# Object-Oriented Programming in C++

This repository contains implementations and practice programs demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using C++**. The code focuses on applying OOP principles through structured examples and problem-solving exercises, ranging from basic class usage to more advanced object-oriented designs.

---

## 📘 Overview

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which combine data and related functions into a single unit. Using C++, this repository explores how OOP concepts can be used to design modular, reusable, and scalable software systems.

The programs included here demonstrate practical implementations of core OOP ideas through well-structured C++ code.

## 🎯 Concepts Covered

This repository covers the following OOP concepts:

- Classes and Objects  
- Encapsulation and Data Hiding  
- Constructors and Destructors  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism and Virtual Functions  
- Operator Overloading  
- Abstraction and Modular Design  

Each concept is implemented using clean and readable C++ code.
